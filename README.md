This often yields more stable and reliable results compared to traditional methods. 

## 🌟 Features

- **Multi-Output Forecasting:** Predict multiple values at once, enhancing your forecasting capabilities.
- **Educational Content:** Includes a step-by-step guide, making it suitable for learners at all levels.
